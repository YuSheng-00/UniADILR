# UniADILR
We propose UniADILR, a novel logical reasoning dataset crafted for assessing the generalization capabilities of LMs across different logical rules. 

More details about __UniADILR__ and evaluations can refer to the paper `Evaluating Generalization Capability of Language Models across
Abductive, Deductive and Inductive Logical Reasoning`.
